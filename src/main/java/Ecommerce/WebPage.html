    <h1>WHY WOOD PRESSED OILS..?</h1>
    <p>Wood pressed oils are crafted using traditional techniques that preserve the natural flavors, nutrients, and purity of the oil. This method, also known as cold pressing, avoids the use of high temperatures and harsh chemicals, ensuring that the oil retains its essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins. Unlike refined oils, wood pressed oils offer a healthier alternative, with more complex flavors and a higher nutritional profile. They are environmentally friendly as well, requiring less energy and producing fewer byproducts. Choose wood pressed oils for a wholesome, eco-friendly choice that supports both your health and the planet.</p>
